-- 20261112_02 — the stacks search finds its matches, or walks to its page.
-- ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
--   get_filtered_stacks_auth_cursor_v2 walked the stacks newest first, asking
--   each whether its title or its author's handle held the word, until its page
--   was full; the handle by an IN (...) reading every member whose handle holds
--   the word. A rare word read most of the stacks, and lists_title_trigram, made
--   for this search, was never used. At 100,000 members (load 43300386906, both
--   timed on one runner): a rare word 57.2 -> 7.3 ms, an author's handle 189.5
--   -> 5.3, a handle many share 301.4 -> 11.8 (both over the 100 ms budget
--   today), a word every stack has 5.9 -> 10.1. A search of three letters or
--   more is counted by the trigram indexes, to 1,000: under 1,000 matches they
--   are read by the indexes, sorted newest first before any per-stack check, and
--   checked in that order until the page is full; with more, or under three
--   letters, the stacks are walked newest first as before, each author's handle
--   looked up as the walk reaches it. The same stacks in the same order, held so
--   on seven searches by the load lab and by the rehearsal on production's own.
